/*
 In truth, using pj_set_searchpath would be easier, but it (and pj_set_finder,
 which would also be easier) has been deprecated and is due to be removed in a
 future release of PROJ. Instead we're doing some shenanigans with testing to
 see if a file with a given name exists in the Framework resources, and reading
 from there preferentially. This is also used instead of trying to set PROJ_LIB,
 as communicating over an environment variable seems janky. It also leaves open
 the option for a user to define PROJ_LIB to point to some data files they
 provide, while still providing the option of the Framework-provided data files.
